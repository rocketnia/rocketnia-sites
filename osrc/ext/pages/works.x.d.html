These are a couple of projects I did in my spare time in 2008, while I
was going to Linfield College.
[file /files/ross-angle-works.zip Download these projects as a zip
file], and you can take a look at their source code or run them (using
Java).

[h3 Jisp, an Interpreted Pseudo-Lisp]

During my side pursuits in college, I was reading about lisp dialects,
and I was especially enticed by
[out http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html Paul Graham's
idealistic depiction of John McCarthy's original Lisp]. Still, some
aspects of what I read about lisp dialects seemed needlessly
inconsistent, such as the non-function-like behavior of [code quote]
and the non-[code quote]-like syntax of string literals.

I'd been formulating my own programming language syntaxes for a while
before this, and something as simple as McCarthy's language seemed
like a good place to start.

Unlike most lisp dialects, Jisp has macros that take [i unparsed
strings] as input, rather than s-expressions. Here's an example, which
you can test for yourself by running
"[code java com.rocketnia.hacks.jisp.Jisp]" from the [code bin]
directory:

[pre [nochops
> (if (eq 'apple (cdr (cons 'pine 'apple))) 'success 'failure)
result: success
> something-we-havent-defined
result: ()
> (function-we-havent-defined 'symbol)
result: (() (quote symbol))
> "(   this  is a     string )
result: "(   this  is a     string )"
> (doublequote      so   is   this   )
result: "so   is   this"
> "and-this
result: "and-this"
> (if (eq 'string (doublequote string)) (exit) 'whoops)
result: whoops
> (if (eq "string (doublequote string)) (exit) 'whoops)
[The REPL terminates.]]]

Jisp has unified semantics for functions, special forms, macros, and
string literals, making it easier to implement them all at once. Aside
from the string part, it's similar to an fexpr-based lisp like Kernel,
but I didn't know that at the time.

Jisp development stopped once I got through the initial challenge of
writing the parser. The implementation of [code lambda] is incomplete,
and there are no meaningful I/O primitives. I would rebuild this kind
of parser from scratch in later projects like
[out https://github.com/rocketnia/blade Blade],
[out https://github.com/rocketnia/penknife Penknife], and chops.js
(part of [out https://github.com/rocketnia/lathe Lathe]) rather than
maintaining the Jisp codebase.


[h3 More Than a Regular Expression Engine]

During college, I found regexes inspiring. Whereas typical expression
evaluation was good at assembling pieces into a whole, regexes were
good for drilling down into existing structures and either replacing
or extracting the pieces. I started making backtracking parser
combinator libraries like this one so I could build regex-like systems
for my own purposes.

Traditional regex systems require every lookbehind expression to have
a maximum length known in advance. This library lifts that limitation.
Every combinator has an interpretation that goes backwards, applying
its match from the end of the string to the beginning.

Traditional regex systems have a backreference operator, to assert
that a certain matched substring appears again at another location in
the overall match. The mechanism I implemented here is somewhat more
expressive: The parser combinators can collect multiple substring
matches under a single name, and another combinator can take a look at
this set and force a backtrack if not all the substrings are
identical.

This code isn't very interactive; it's just a library. If you want to
see it in action anyway, you can run
"[code java com.rocketnia.hacks.myregex.MyRegexTest]", a rudimentary
unit test which does a single match.
