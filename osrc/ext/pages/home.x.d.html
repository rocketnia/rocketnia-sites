((This is the open source version of my site. The [out https://www.rocketnia.com/ online version] has a bit more content.))

Hi, I'm Ross Angle. I like to go by Rocketnia, or Nia for short. (Interested in my [nav /resume/ resume]? I'm on the lookout for the right company! Feel free to contact me at rokitna?hotmail.???.)

I'd like to simplify programming for everyone. My programming languages under the [out https://github.com/era-platform Era] umbrella are my efforts toward that goal. Some of the work involves utility libraries I refer to collectively as [out https://github.com/lathe Lathe], with which I aim to spruce up existing languages with the additional techniques I'm embracing for Era. And some of my tinkering takes place in one-off projects on [out https://github.com/rocketnia my own GitHub profile]. Here are a few examples:

[cdiv project
  [cene-logo]
  [cdiv project-name Cene Mk. I]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://era-platform.github.io/cene/ website]
    | [out https://github.com/era-platform/cene#readme repo]
    | [out https://cene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ docs]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    A pure functional language with concurrent macroexpansion and a JavaScript FFI. I've built a [out https://github.com/era-platform/cene-scaffold/blob/18056655dcc29c023fde6191567f425cbcedf72a/src/main.cene#L149 text generation DSL] in Cene, as well as a [out https://github.com/rocketnia/mise-en.cene/blob/bed693477bb96fbe6b3a2ca5a45fe49abf979fda/src/demo.cene#L103 little screenplay-like DSL].
    
    [out https://github.com/era-platform/cene-for-racket#readme Cene Mk. II] is the latest experimental work on Cene, rebuilding it with better error messages, a module system, and a few other refinements.]]

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name Fexpress]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://github.com/rocketnia/fexpress#readme repo]
    | [out https://docs.racket-lang.org/fexpress/index.html docs]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    A proof-of-concept language core in which fexprs and compiled functions can coexist.]]

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name Underreact]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://github.com/rocketnia/underreact#readme repo]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    A dataflow library that could form the underlying plumbing of a continuous-time functional reactive programming language.
    
    This makes some sort of snazzy demos, including a [out https://rocketnia.github.io/underreact/test/canvas-fancy.html demo of some state machines] and a [out https://rocketnia.github.io/underreact/test/platformer.html
    demo of a rudimentary platform game]. [<]Warning: Some flickering.[>]]]

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name Punctaffy]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://github.com/lathe/punctaffy-for-racket#readme repo]
    | [out https://docs.racket-lang.org/punctaffy/index.html docs]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    A rather abstract library I worked on to figure out the more subtle intricacies of designing extensible templating languages.]]

General-purpose programming language design isn't my only pursuit. Here are some other nifty projects I've made:

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name Rocketnia.com]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://github.com/rocketnia/rocketnia-sites repo for the open-source subset of the site]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    The website you're looking at is written in a static site generator I made myself called [out https://github.com/rocketnia/chopsgen Chopsgen]. It uses the same kind of deterministic concurrency model that went into the Cene macroexpander.
    
    I wrote this static site generator at a time when I wanted to be able to run all my code in the browser, even the build tools themselves. In a clone of the repo, the file html-build.html shows a preview of the site in an iframe, and it offers a button to download the processed .html files in a .zip archive, ready to be unpacked and uploaded. In practice, I actually do a more sophisticated kind of deployment, but it's nice to have this as a fallback.]]

[cdiv project
  [rainbow-js-logo]
  [cdiv project-name Rainbow.js]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://github.com/arclanguage/rainbow-js#readme repo]
    | [out https://arclanguage.github.io/rainbow-js/test/#libs try Rainbow.js online]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    Rainbow.js is a JavaScript port of the [out https://arclanguage.github.io/ Arc programming language] (specifically a port of Conan Dalton's implementation of it, [out https://github.com/conanite/rainbow#readme Rainbow]).]]

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name Writing prompt generators]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://github.com/rocketnia/monday-comics repo]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    Some creative tools I've made to inspire writing ideas: A very simple [out https://rocketnia.github.io/monday-comics/ prompt generator] for scenarios where characters get into tomfoolery related to their unique talents, and an [out https://rocketnia.github.io/monday-comics/episodic-adventure-generator.html interactive plot structure generator] based on graph rewriting.]]

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name Mega Man IV and V password generators]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://www.rocketnia.com/password-cracks/ website]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    Some password generators for Mega Man IV and V for Game Boy.]]

I have some storytelling pursuits, too:

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name Symple Home Renovations]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://rocketnia.itch.io/symple-home-renovations play on Itch.io]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    [i Magic makes home renovations easier than ever. Almost too easy.]
    
    Inspired by [out https://seltani.net/ Seltani], I made a little text-based game engine ([out https://github.com/rocketnia/contrivertext#readme ContriverText]) to try out some different UI ideas for multiplayer interactive hypertext fiction. The interface could use a lot of work, especially for a single-player demo like this one. However, for the [out https://itch.io/jam/bring-out-your-dead Bring Out Your Dead] game jam, I put together this short work to showcase the engine. There are some more author's notes on the [out https://itch.io/jam/bring-out-your-dead/rate/73015 jam submission page].]]

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name The Shape of Our Container]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://www.rocketnia.com/if/shape-of-our-container/play/ play online]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    A little hypertext piece I made for a [out https://ifdb.org/viewcomp?id=w7c92kqrhij4kt8h game jam on the theme of "tiny utopias."]]]

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name Megalomaniac]
  [cdiv project-links
    [out https://www.rocketnia.com/megalomaniac/ read online]]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    A short-lived Mega Man sprite comic I started while I was really into [out https://www.bobandgeorge.com/ Bob and George].]]

[cdiv project
  [cdiv project-name MyAI and Mikkamon]
  
  [cdiv project-description
    I could talk all day about some of my original characters and settings. Telling their stories in full is a daunting prospect, one that I might even need better programming languages for. :-p But I've occasionally written up some notes about [out https://github.com/rocketnia/myai-franchise#readme MyAI] and [out https://github.com/rocketnia/mikkamon#readme Mikkamon] on GitHub to get the ideas out there somewhere.]]

Thanks for visiting my little place on the web. I hope you enjoy your stay!

Feel free to contact me over email at rokitna?hotmail.???.

A lot of my online activity is in the form of maintaining my [out https://github.com/rocketnia open source repos].

Lately, I spend a lot of my time in the [out https://racket-lang.org/ Racket programming language]'s Slack and Discord communities, as well as hanging out with friends at the [out https://www.twitch.tv/multitapmugen Multitap Twitch channel].

If you want to read programming discussions I've participated in, there are several old posts I've made on [out http://arclanguage.org/newest the Arc Forum] as rocketnia and [out http://www.lambda-the-ultimate.org/ Lambda the Ultimate] as Ross Angle.

Sometimes, I update [out https://rocketnia.wordpress.com/ my programming blog].
