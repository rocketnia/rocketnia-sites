I'm Ross Angle, a big-dreaming programmer. I like to start out with a
grand creative vision in mind, but then boil off all the "easy" parts
until only abstract paradoxes are left over. Then I seek out practical
resolutions for those paradoxes instead of tackling the creative
project as a whole. I look forward to a life collaborating with other
creative people who would otherwise get tripped up on this kind of
deep technical paradox in their own work, and I hope to leave behind a
suite of reusable tools for future dreamers' sake.

Occasionally I do take my head out of the clouds and do a small
fanwork or two. I have a particular fanaticism for self-parodying
stories, especially comedy anime.

For the past few years I've been considering how I could make the
world a better place with my skills. I try not to make many
assumptions about what kind of ethics the people of the future will
live by, but I figure they'll be most satisfied in a world with
sustained peace and frequent opportunities for grassroots enterprise.
My specialty is technology, but technology can often introduce new
gaps of unexplored ethical territory, potentially leading to bitter,
unpeaceful disagreement. On the other hand, relatively "secure"
technology has relatively few ethical gaps, and technology for
communication and self-expression can potentially help us resolve our
disagreements as they come up. I'll try to produce the good stuff!

[h3 How you can find me]

Feel free to contact me over email at rokitna?hotmail.???.

If you just want to Internet-stalk me, you can find me posting on
[out http://arclanguage.org/newest the Arc Forum] as rocketnia and
[out http://www.lambda-the-ultimate.org/ Lambda the Ultimate] as
Ross Angle.

Occasionally I update [out http://github.com/rocketnia my GitHub
repos], [out http://rocketnia.wordpress.com/ my programming blog],
and (least frequently) this website. There's a lot that doesn't see
the light of day in any of these venues; I tend to post about my work
when I have something self-contained and relatively complete in
purpose, and even then I often choose to get caught up in the next
phase of the project right away.
