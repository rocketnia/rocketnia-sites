I'm Ross Angle. I program, and I particularly like metaprogramming,
metafiction, metamathematics, and sometimes even metagames and
metalogic. Or maybe it's less of a meta- interest and more of an
interdisciplinary one; I'm a fan of fiction that's about fiction, but
I also like imagining programs that manage logic or games that
simulate fiction. In the end, what I think about are abstract systems,
and what I usually produce are programs that express them.

On this site... well, actually there isn't much here. That's because
this is the open source version of the site, and most content is
closed source for now. If you want to see some projects I've done,
out [out http://github.com/rocketnia my GitHub profile] or
[out http://www.rocketnia.com/ my online site]!

For some random musings about projects I [em haven't] done yet, check
out [out http://rocketnia.wordpress.com/ my blog].

[h3 How can you find me?]

You can contact me over email at rokitna?hotmail.???. (Note that
Hotmail's a bit of an anomaly; usually I go by the username
[quotepunc . rocketnia])

Primarily you'll find me at [out http://arclanguage.org/newest the Arc
Forum], where I try to be informative here and there, oftentimes
persistently pointing out things people may have overlooked (bugs and
design flaws), in what I can only hope is perceived as a helpful
spirit. ^_^ I also find myself writing a lot of little demos to
demonstrate the stuff I'm talking about, so it's a good way to keep my
programming fresh and practical.

Aside from that, I occasionally post to the [out
http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75842/134782/rules_theory_and_templating
[cite Rules Theory and Templating]] Magic: the Gathering forum at the
Wizards of the Coast community. There, [em everybody's] trying to be
critical and helpful. :-p I have some proactive suggestions for the
game, but I like thinking about the game no matter what it is now and
what it might be changed into, so I typically contribute by coming up
with a hypothetical solution others haven't thought of for a problem
some other poster has perceived.

The rest of my online activity takes the form of
[out http://github.com/rocketnia GitHub commits]. I do have
[out http://www.facebook.com/ross.angle a Facebook presence] I kinda
sorta keep up, and then there's
[out http://rocketnia.wordpress.com/ the blog] and this website, and
naturally it goes downhill from there, with plenty of other online
accounts that aren't really worth mentioning. ^_^
