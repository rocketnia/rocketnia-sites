I'm Ross Angle, a programming language designer and metafiction fan
who wants to build abstraction techniques that will help society be
mindful of new and unfamiliar social entities.

Often I come up with ideas for artistic goals like making AMVs or
authoring some original stories, but then I divert that motivation to
the task of building the tools that would support that kind of project
instead. That's been an okay dynamic. As of this writing,
[out https://era-platform.github.io/cene/ my programming language
Cene] is polished enough that I can use it, but I'm still tempted to
write a package manager and a UI library before I build creative works
on top of it.


[h3 How you can find me]

Feel free to contact me over email at rokitna?hotmail.???. (If you're
a recruiter: I'm sorry to say I almost never respond to recruiters
unless I'm actively looking for work.)

If you want to read programming discussions I've participated in,
there are several old posts I've made on
[out http://arclanguage.org/newest the Arc Forum] as rocketnia and
[out http://www.lambda-the-ultimate.org/ Lambda the Ultimate] as
Ross Angle. Hmm, lately I've been discussing my language progress in
more private places, unfortunately.

Occasionally I update [out http://github.com/rocketnia my GitHub
repos], [out http://rocketnia.wordpress.com/ my programming blog],
and (least frequently) this website.

The repos are probably the best way to see my latest progress and
notes.
