I'm Ross Angle, otherwise known as Rocketnia or Nia. Some people might
know me from the Racket programming language community's Slack or
Discord channels, or from the Arc Forum. Some people might know me
from being a casual onlooker in the interactive fiction world. I
consider myself a fan of character-centric tomfoolery fiction and
colorful platform games, and yet I often enjoy these things for the
plot. I love discovering ways to combine things that brings out the
unique advantages they all have, so it's no surprise that I'm a fan of
obscure combo decks in Magic: The Gathering.

I have many of my own creative projects, like story and game ideas,
that I occasionally tinker on. Many of them are so ambitious that I
don't know if I'll ever finish them. I spend a lot of my time working
not directly on these projects, but on reusable tools that can
facilitate many creative works all at once. Many of my dream projects
have extensionality as a central feature, like a rules-enforcing
tabletop game engine where people can add their own new cards or house
rules, so coming up with languages or APIs for those extension
facilities is an essential part of the project.

For these reasons and more, I've devoted a lot of my hobby energy to
designing and developing new programming languages. (I've actually
been doodling language designs ever since I first learned programming,
so perhaps I like it for its own sake.)

Most programming ecosystems rely on tools that have complex,
unspecified behavior that's only implemented for one platform. Many of
those tools don't offer realistic paths to gradually improve or
replace them without starting over. I consider a simple internal representation, a deterministic module system, and
modularity-respecting language extension (e.g. a hygienic macro
system) to be essential ways to let programmers upgrade and replace
the language they're using. Unfortunately, module systems are usually
ad hoc and full of global namespaces (such as search paths) and
opportunities for side effects that interfere with deterministic
module composition. Macro systems, meanwhile, are rarely hygienic and
rarely facilitate good error messages or incremental compilation.

The lambda calculus is capable of being given higher-dimensional
semantics for (space-indexed) distributed programming, (time-indexed)
reactive programming, and (homotopic path-indexed) mechanized proofs
of program compatibility. In spite of this, most programming languages
have unsound type systems and allow the pervasive use of imperative
side effects, which impedes their ability to take advantage of this
design space.

There are amazing developments in programming languages all the time,
but there's a lot of room to improve.

The languages I've made aren't silver bullets. Not yet, anyway! :-p I
am just one person, and for most of my time designing these, I've been
content with low-quality error messages and highly unconventional
workflows that I don't expect others to care for. For instance, I've
written many of my compilers in JavaScript so that I could run them
from an HTML page on a mobile device. Even the static site generator I
built for this website can be run that way, using inter-frame
communication as a makeshift module system.

I've been spending the past few years polishing up my practices (and
continuing to explore). The compiler for my language
[out https://era-platform.github.io/cene/ Cene] can be installed from
npm and run from the command line, which makes it a lot more like
other programming languages and makes it easier to integrate into
continuous integration and deployment setups. I've been doing an
extensive
[out https://github.com/era-platform/cene-for-racket rewrite of Cene]
to improve the provenance-tracking of error messages and to give it a
module system with separate compilation support. In the process of
doing this, I've untangled many of my programming language ideas into
[out https://github.com/lathe individual Racket libraries] and written
documentation for them so that they can be understood independently
from each other.

One of the most intense projects from late 2016 to early 2021 has been
[out https://docs.racket-lang.org/punctaffy/index.html Punctaffy].
What started out as an idea for factoring out parts of a string
template DSL language into individual libraries turned out to require
quite a few concepts from category theory before I could be confident
in the design approach and implement it with the generality I expected
it to have. The basic idea is that, like a "program with holes in it,"
we might think about having a "program-with-holes-in-it with
(program-with-holes-in-it)-shaped holes in it" and so on. See the
[out https://docs.racket-lang.org/punctaffy/index.html intro page] for
a more practical introduction and the
[out https://docs.racket-lang.org/punctaffy/motivation.html
  motivation page]
for several places I think this concept will come in handy in the
future.

Now that Punctaffy is working, I'm excited to get back to some more
creative projects.


[h4 How you can find me]

Feel free to contact me over email at rokitna?hotmail.???.

If you want to read programming discussions I've participated in,
there are several old posts I've made on
[out http://arclanguage.org/newest the Arc Forum] as rocketnia and
[out http://www.lambda-the-ultimate.org/ Lambda the Ultimate] as
Ross Angle. Lately I've been participating in the Racket community's
Slack and Discord, which aren't as easy to link to.

Occasionally I update my open source repos,
[out https://rocketnia.wordpress.com/ my programming blog], and (least
frequently) this website.

My open source repositories are actually split into a few places:

[ul [li My own [out https://github.com/rocketnia GitHub profile].]
    [li The [out https://github.com/era-platform Era platform]
        organization on GitHub, which I made to collect my
        general-purpose language projects into one place. The two main
        languages are Era (still little more than scattered notes at
        this point) and
        [out https://era-platform.github.io/cene/ Cene].]
    [li The [out https://github.com/lathe Lathe] organization on
        GitHub, which I made to collect the various libraries I'm
        building to serve as demonstrations and infrastructure for the
        ideas in the Era language projects.]]

Watching my commits to these repos is probably the best way to find
out about my latest progress and ideas.
