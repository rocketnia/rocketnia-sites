Here are some examples of the number format:

[ul [li 123]
    [li 123.456]
    [li -123.456]
    [li 123^789]
    [li -123.456^-789]
    [li [<]NaN[>]]
    [li [<]Infinity[>]]
    [li -[<]Infinity[>]]]

Each base [i n] uses the first [i n] digits out of the the sequence
(0-9A-Z). You don't have to worry about capitalization.

The '^' symbol is used in place of an 'e' so as not to conflict with
bases over 14 that use 'e' as a digit. The number 1.2^4 is in
scientific notation and should be read "one point two times ten to the
fourth."

Internally, these numbers are represented as JavaScript numbers, which
is to say they're IEEE-754 doubles. However, the display code isn't
accurate to quite that level of precision, so it intentionally strips
off the least significant digit.

[h3 About this project]

I did this for a class assignment at Linfield College in 2008. It's an
early example of the kind of immediate feedback UI I like to build,
and at the time it was the only four-function calculator I'd seen that
dealt with floating-point numbers in bases other than 10 or 2.
